# Quick Sort

## Assignment

Review the pseudocode below, then trace the algorithm by stepping through the process with the provided sample array. Document your explanation by creating a blog article that shows the step-by-step output after each iteration through some sort of visual.

Once you are done with your article, code a working, tested implementation of Quick Sort based on the pseudocode provided.

You may review an example document [HERE](../class-26/solutions/BLOG){:target="_blank"}

## Pseudo Code

```javascript
ALGORITHM QuickSort(arr, left, right)
    if left < right
        // Partition the array by setting the position of the pivot value
        DEFINE position <-- Partition(arr, left, right)
        // Sort the left
        QuickSort(arr, left, position - 1)
        // Sort the right
        QuickSort(arr, position + 1, right)

ALGORITHM Partition(arr, left, right)
    // set a pivot value as a point of reference
    DEFINE pivot <-- arr[right]
    // create a variable to track the largest index of numbers lower than the defined pivot
    DEFINE low <-- left - 1
    for i <- left to right do
        if arr[i] <= pivot
            low++
            Swap(arr, i, low)

     // place the value of the pivot location in the middle.
     // all numbers smaller than the pivot are on the left, larger on the right.
     Swap(arr, right, low + 1)
    // return the pivot index point
     return low + 1

ALGORITHM Swap(arr, i, low)
    DEFINE temp;
    temp <-- arr[i]
    arr[i] <-- arr[low]
    arr[low] <-- temp
```

## Sample Arrays

In your blog article, visually show the output of processing this input array:

`[8,4,23,42,16,15]`

For your own understanding, consider also stepping through these inputs:

- Reverse-sorted: `[20,18,12,8,5,-2]`
- Few uniques: `[5,12,7,5,5,7]`
- Nearly-sorted: `[2,3,5,7,13,11]`

### Implementation

- Provide a visual step through for each of the sample arrays based on the provided pseudo code
- Convert the pseudo-code into working code in your language
- Present a complete set of working tests

## Requirements

Ensure your complete code solution follows the standard requirements.

1. Write [unit tests](../../Challenge_Testing){:target="_blank"}
1. Follow the [template for a well-formatted README](../../Challenge_Documentation){:target="_blank"}
